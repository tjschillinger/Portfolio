            <h2>This mobile app challenged me to design a prototype for investors using <b>User Stories, Sketch, and Invision</b>.</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Time Swap is a startup based in Malaysia that wants to disrupt the marketplace by allowing people to exchange time rather than money. I was honored to be brought on board, especially since money is a representation of labor time, and I thought it was pretty cool to use technology to bypass social conventions.<a href="https://tjschillinger.github.io/Turf_Smurfs/" target="_blank"><b> EXPLORE TIME SWAP.</b></a>
        </p>
  </div>
  <div class = "column full">
        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>The problem I was commissioned to solve was that of making a vision into a tangible reality. The startup knew what they wanted to accomplish: making an easy-to-use marketplace to allow people to exchange time. Yet they didn't know how this would work in practice. <b>It was my role to visualize this marketplace in a user-friendly way</b>. My solution was to step into the user's shoes to create a story that users would materialize. From there I would develop user flows, wireframes, mockups, and finally a prototype for Time Swap to show off to investors.
      </p>
  </div>
    <div id="survey" class = "column full padpad">
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>I needed to define my audience. Who is the protagonist of this story? Interviews and surveys gave me the materials to build personas. These personalities afforded me the relationships and expectations that would act as glue for user flows and site maps. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h4>Survey to Personas</h4>
        <p>The primary aim of my survey was to define the app's users in terms of demographics, objectives, and method of trust building.  
      </p>
  </div>
    <div class = "img-background column full full-imgs top-img">
        <p>Primary Users: Mothers and Seniors</p>
         <img src = "images/Survey_Demographics.png">
       </div>
    <div class = "img-background column full full-imgs top-img">
         <p>Primary Objectives: Moving, Yard Work, and Animal Care</p>

         <img src = "images/Survey_Results.png">
    </div>
    <div class = "column full padpad">
        <p>I developed personas from this data to help visualize the app's protagonists. From now on, any design direction would be framed by looking at these personas and asking, "does it match their needs and expectations?".   
      </p>

        <h4>Site Map</h4>
        <p>How would my protagonists get to their goals? A site map helped me to get a feel of the movement of the user and how I could abstractly make it a smooth experience.

        <h3>Layouts</h3>
        <p>With the research foundations laid, I now set out to visualize the environment the users would inhabit. I started with free-hand sketches, then moved to wireframes, and finally high fideity mockups.

        <p><br><br>The landing page needed to capture user trust for them to consider booking Turf Smurf’s services. To build trust, I included Turf Smurf’s values in the beginning and also some testimonials from locals who have used their services.<br><br>I designed the navigation to be simple and my first call to action button easily navigates a user to the services page where they can not only view the services but also request a free estimate.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>After presenting the layout to my client, they inquired about having information segregated on separate pages instead of a longer landing page. I explained to them the benefits of having the most important content all included on the landing page with the option for users to click into other pages for further information. This accomodates the natural laziness of users to minimize the clicks needed to get the information. The client agreed, and I delivered the following design.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h4>Landing Page</h4>
        <p>You’ll notice the landing page has changed in layout to accomodate a more modern and edgy design. I also wanted to conserve more space and allow the users gaze to more easily navigate the information without having to bounce around excessively. 
      </p>
  </div>
    <div class = "img-background column full med-single top-img">
         <img src = "images/Turf_Smurfs_Landing.png">
       </div>
    <div class = "column full padpad">
        <h4>Services Page</h4>
        <p>Originally, the services page did not include the gallery, meet the team, or estimate sections but through user testing I decided this would be necessary to lead the user further into the site. Plus, when users are browsing services they naturally want to reaffirm their initial trust by seeing the gallery of work or actual members of the team that would be servicing their lawn. In addition, it only makes sense to be able to scroll down and request an estimate right away on the same page.
      </p>
  </div>
    <div class = "img-background column full med-single top-img">
         <img src = "images/Turf_Smurfs_Services.png">
    </div>
    <div class = "column full padpad">
        <h4>About Page</h4>
        <p>The about section did not include photos and bios of the team originally, just the companies values. This new section however, is a huge add value for users wanting a more personal introduction to the team. This also builds trust.
      </p>
  </div>
    <div class = "img-background column full med-single top-img">

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p><a href="https://tjschillinger.github.io/Turf_Smurfs/" target="_blank"><b>EXPLORE TURF SMURFS</b></a></p>
        <p>I was able to solve all three user stories and balance the needs of the user with the vision of the company as well. I provided users a way to view services,  and request an estimate. I also designed features for the site that would build trust, such as the testimonials, values, and photos of the employees with their bios. Last but not least, I kept the site very minimal and modern which fell right in line with the vision of the company. Users can now navigate the site with ease. For me, as a designer, this project was  real win!
