            <p>You're convinced: giving is a good idea for your business. But how does it work? We work with you to determine:<br><br> 
 
            1. You're level of commitment. Are you looking to donate big? Are you wanting to try it out first with a conservative donation? What is a good size to donate? 
             <br><br>  
                2. Which types of services and products should your business donate. The best results for your business will come from aligning our users interests with what your business offers. 
            <br><br>  
                3. Your desired radius of distribution. Do you want to offer donations online or in store? Will you give only to locals or across the country?  
            <br><br>  
                Once all these factors are determined and your donations are up and running, we actively help spread the word about your business' generosity. After picking up a donation from your business, we ask our users to either: 
            <br><br> 
                1. Review your product or service, or<br> 
                2. Like your Facebook page, or<br>

                <p>I have a good crew of energetic people. The type you can rely on. But even they need to see a bigger picture from time to time. Human Kind helped with that. Most of my employees use Human Kind themselves, so they already knew all the good it does. It's cool to see them chat with our customers about how they help other people. I think it helps brighten their day to make a personal connection with our customers. In fact, this quarter has had the lowest turnover I've had since opening three years ago. So it must be working. I knew Hunan Kind would help the community and my business, but I was surprised to see it help my employees. </p>

                <p>Making a name for yourself within appararel industry is hard, real hard. Especially in Denver. I needed some help, so I got in touch with Humand Kind. I was waery at first. Giving away my product for free wasn't something I was used to. But the results have been fantastic. I had about 12 google reviews before Human Kind and now I'm about to break 100. What's better is that I know that the people I'm giving to deserve it. They aren't people looking for a hand out but actually went out there and did something for someone. How could I not reward that?</p>

                <p>When I became a sponsor for human kind, I didn't know what to expect. I thought, well at the very least it'll show I care about the community. What I didn't expect was for the community to show that they cared about me. When I started donating, it seem that for every flower I gave, I was returned with a referal for a wedding or funneral to cater. Now I have pastors and even company dinners I prodive for. When word spreads it spreads like wild fire. I've always sold top-notch flowers, but if no one knows it, then my store sits empty. My only regret is not sponsoring Human Kind sooner.</p>
