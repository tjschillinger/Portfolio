        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>heartbeatz gave my team and me the opportunity to explore JavaScript and jQuery through the medium of a music app. The functionality of the project is simple in concept: it consists of a homepage, a Collection page, and an album page, but it’s the engine of this site that carries its complexity. Under the hood, we programmed blocks of code to generate the Collection page’s content, cycle through albums for the album page, and present information for the player bar. In addition to these features, we gave the site a slick coat of paint by rebranding it from its original direction. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column half half-text-left">
        <h4>Task</h4>
        <p>We were tasked with programming a fexible web application to play music, using minimal reliance on HTML. This project was important to us because we wanted to explore the dexterity of JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column half half-text-right">
        <h4> The Problem </h4>
        <p>We needed to create a site that could update content without constant maintenance to the HTML. Such maintenance would cost too much time and energy. We needed a site with flexible content.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h4> The Solution </h4>
        <p>The key to our solution placed a heavy emphasis on using JavaScript to reduce our dependency on HTML. Moreover, we reduced the labor of JavaScript by employing jQuery. The result amounted to a malleable library within our JavaScript files that could insert content into our static HTML files.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h3>Technical Side</h3>
        <h4>Generating Collection Page Content</h4>
        <p>We kept to a minimum the code for our Collection HTML page by leaving the content between our section tags bare.</p>

    <div class = "img-background column full">
      <div class = "one-img column full">

        <p>Future Content Would Fill This Free Space in the Section Tag</p>  
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <p>In our collection.js, we generated content for our Collection page by using a variable to create an object that would be our album and a for loop to customize the number of album objects for our collection.html.</p>

        <h4>Generating Play Bar Content</h4>
        <p>The content for our play bar required maximum flexibility, using JavaScript to produce most of its content. Our Album HTML page, which hosted the placement of our play bar, was coded similarly to our collection.html, in that we coded tags without content.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <p>To fill those areas with content, we used many variables, functions, conditional statements, and objects within our album.js file to insert and remove information for our player bar while allowing the user to adjust settings (such as volume and seek bar).</p>

        <p>Refactoring with jQuery: With the main goal of our project being to reduce the amount of code required to make a simple music player, we employed jQuery to reduce the amount of space taken up by our JavaScript. The space reduced by refactoring our JavaScript is self evident. <a href="heartbeatz-home.html">Check out the live demo.</a>

            <h4>What We Learned</h4>
            <p>Going in, we didn’t expect to discover so many ways to program the effect we wanted to produce with JavaScript. After programming a solution, we would show our code to a third party for feedback, only to discovery an even more succinct way to code our solution. We enjoyed this process of discovery.</p>

            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <p>Collaboration is essential to filing down a finely-tuned solution. No matter how much you think you know about JavaScript and jQuery, there will always be more to learn.</p>

        <h3>Rebranding</h3>
        <h4>Creative Brief</h4>
        <p>Music is passion and life without it is void of happiness. That’s why when my design team and I had an opportunity to work on a rebrand design for a responsive music site I was ecstatic! Music is what makes work seem like play and I couldn’t wait to play with the colors and designs of this site. The majority of the content would be staying the same but the colors, logo, hero image, and name were up for grabs! The site was antiquated and it needed to be rebranded to bring it back to life.<br><br>My team and I immediately began brainstorming themes for the rebrand so we would know what direction to take our design. We ended up determining our rebrand theme based on our mutual feeling that music = passion and passion inspires life.<br><br>Bloc Jams, the previous site name, no longer made sense with our narrative of passion. Bloc implies something that is blocky, or clunky which can be some peoples love story but not ours! We needed a name that got to the heart of what we’re about-passion and music.  Sound Waves, FreeStyle, SongRise, and Pump were all initial brainstorming contenders but we landed on heartbeatz to portray the interlay of music and passion.</p>

        <h4>Logo</h4>
        <p>From there we brainstormed ideas for a logo. We considered headphones, music notes, record machines and vinyl. Vinyl was exciting but we determined it would not help the site shake off it’s antiquated feel. Nothing was sticking and then BOOM-we came up with a design that struck a chord in each of us! We would design a heart that would hint at a B design as well for heartbeatz. We decided to put the heart in a line from a heart beat but the logo wasn’t as scalable as we would have preferred and the combination of the logo and site name would have been too much for a navigation bar. We dropped the line from the heartbeat but kept the B heart. The heart isn’t closed at the bottom but it spreads out on both sides. This passion is not contained but it reaches out to others!</p>

        <h4>Color Palette</h4>
        <p>Colors were up next! We wanted to insinuate passion and love without coming across as sappy or overly feminine. We played around with a variety of reds but the colors were too bright and we were afraid that our desire for passion would turn into a giant red stop sign instead! As a result we started adding some white to the mix and entered the realm of the pinks! We didn’t want cotton candy to be on the mind so we started heading for more peachy tones and voila! From the peachy tones were were able to come up with the complementary mint greens and tans.</p>

        <h4 id="heartbeatz-demo">Landing Page Image</h4>
        <p>The final thing that needed rebranding was the hero image but that was easy with the new foundation we had finished laying for the site. We found an image of a woman, listening to music (of course) her hair vibrantly colored and in motion to show a streak of rebellion. <a href="heartbeatz-home.html">Check out the live demo.</a></p>

       <h3> Reflections</h3>
        <p>Standing back from the project my design team and I smiled. Sometimes working gets mundane and we end up with projects that are less exciting than others. Working on a project that intended to build passion in others had consequently built the passion in us as well. It reminded us why we love design. Design is about friendly functionality above all else but it’s also about bringing life to projects that are dying. We spend a lot of time pumping energy into designs that may or may not thank us later on for birthing them but the satisfying ones are the ones that give back to you as much as you pour into them. And that was this rebrand design.
