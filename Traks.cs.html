        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> Traks is a site all about stories, so it seems best to tell you the story of how we, my wife and I, created it. We were living in Colorado, visiting everywhere from Denver to Grand Junction. One day we were reminiscing about our adventures when the same conclusion came up again and again- “I don’t remember.” It was the death sentence of an experience and that’s what we set out to solve -the resurrection and preservation of a travel experience.
        </p>
    </div>
      <div class = " column full">
        <h4 class = "Black">Task</h4>
        <p> I was tasked with designing a web site that aided people in organizing their travel experiences -past, present, and future- allowing them to capture all their experiences and accessing them from anywhere. This project was important to me because of my passion for traveling and my frustrations with displaying my travel portfolio in a beautiful, approachable way.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class = "column full">
        <h4 class="Black">Problem</h4>
        <p>  There is no digital space to hold an entire travel experience -such as, personal ratings, media, maps, and journal entries. Moreover, no medium existed to share an entire experience or invite others to collaborate on a new one. This leaves people full of memories and plans but no network to express and share them.
        </p>
      </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h4 class = "Black">Solution</h4>
        <p>  Traks allows people to trace their travels. In one digital space, users can upload media, record their thoughts, rate their individual experiences, visualize their tracks, and share with friends and family. A user can also look forward by planning a journey by allowing them to define destinations, transportation, companions, and travel dates. Or, if the user isn’t quite ready to plan out a journey, they can create a wishlist, which is also visualized on their map. And finally, once a user wants to publish their travels in a physical book, they can publish it through a site like Blurb.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h3>Survey </h3>
        <p>  To gain insights from users and protect against biases, I sent out a survey to discover what was meaningful to potential users. This step was crucial because it helped to keep my ideas grounded in reality and the project oriented toward users.
        </p>
        <h4 class ="Black"> Survey Intentions</h4>
        <p> With my survey I wanted to understand:</p>
        <p>
          1. The value of visual representation through a map.<br><br>
              2. The value of a rating system connected to individual experiences of a location.<br><br>
              3. What factors determined a location worthy of travel.<br><br>
              4. What aspects of a travel are important to record.<br><br>
              5. The value of publishing travel experiences through a site like Blurb.
        </p>
        <h4 class ="Black">Survey Results</h4>
        <p>1. 70% of people found a map valuable. <br><br>
            2. 70% of people found ratings to be valuable.<br><br>
            3. 88% of people said cost was important, 55% distance, 55% physical environment, 55% past experiences. <br><br>
            4. 100% of people found photos to be valuable for storing, 60% videos, 40% journal
          entries, 40% ratings.<br><br>
            5. 20% of people found the Blurb feature valuable.
        </p>
        <h4 class = "Black">Survey Inferences</h4>
        <p><b>Affirmed-</b> The survey informed me that a map, ratings, and media were worthwhile to the MVP.<br><br>
        <b>Denied-</b> I decided to drop the Blurb idea due to a lack of interest. Also, I had the idea to include voice recordings as a media option, but there was a lack of interest in this feature as well, so I dropped it too from the MVP.<br><br>
        <b>Insights-</b> From the survey, I realized that I needed to include a cost rating within the experience ratings.

        <h3>Competition</h3>
        <p> Traks has two main components: sociability and archive navigability. Furthermore, the website had no direct competition, but its main components did. With these concepts being the goal I looked primarily at three sites: Facebook, Roadtrippers, and Nomad List.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Facebook, while the industry standard of social media, does little over a lot, giving many social options, but lacking depth in individual experience. For Traks, I wanted everything oriented around the user’s travel experiences. <br><br>
              2. Roadtrippers does a great job allowing the user to plan their trip and their map feature is great for viewing a potential route. However, it is one-dementional, allowing users to only plan a trip without carrying forward that information as some sort of travel log once the trip is executed.<br><br>
              3. Nomad List provides an intuitive way to filter choices and rank locations based on what the user chooses, yet it doesn’t allow a way to connect with friends, see their ratings, or collaborate.

        <h3>Brand Identity</h3>
        <p> Traks was intended from the outset to be a personal, yet social platform for the user’s travel experiences. Originally, I thought the name of the site would be “Travel Bug,” due to the explorative nature of the site’s users. However, bugs annoy people, and it didn’t capture the personal and social spirit of the site. Thus, I landed on “Traks,” because it reminded me of a personal imprint left behind by a traveler, something similar to a fingerprint. Naturally, this led to a footprint as the focal point of the logo. As for the social nature of the site, I went with a stamp border around the logo, which also tied in nicely with the digital postcard idea pushed by my survey.

      <p>For fonts, I wanted the titles to look strong and permanent, so I chose Bitter due to its strong, angular design. As for paragraphs, I wanted an easy-to-read font that was as non-distracting as possible. Thus, Poppins was my choice, especially since it was crafted with a digital screen display in mind.
      </p>
      <p>The color palette needed to be comprised of colors that were active yet calming, because of the explorative spirit of the intended users, and calming because I knew that users would be inputing a lot of information and traveling can easily lead to stress. I concluded that oranges and blues would dominate the palette.

        <h3>Mockups</h3>
        <p>With research and brand identity under my belt, I began conceptualizing where on the pages the information would live. This part of the project consumed most of my time, as I first developed low fidelity mockups and then moved onto high fidelity. I regularly sent my designs to users and peers for feedback. Consequently, my mockups went through quite the evolution before reaching Traks Erectus.<br><br>This evolution of the content's layout can be readily seen in the difference between my low fidelity mockups and my high fidelity ones.</p></div>

I had to rescale over two hundred mockups -an action that solidified a lesson I won't soon forget.</p>

        <p>Expert advice through my process informed me that my work was too bulky and boxy. It was a common mistake for designers to place everything within a explicitly defined space. This way of thinking can create a very closed design, so my goal now became opening it up more. It was a breath of fresh air removing the boxes throughout the site. It did make a cleaner, freer design and has since contributed to my more minimalist direction.

       <h3> Reflections</h3>
        <p>This project taught me how to design holistically. I learned to work together as a team with very different designers to created a website that looked uniform. I also learned more about how all the different steps in designing for the project's “big picture.”
        </p>
        <p>Something useful I started doing in the project was the creation of a “purgatory” to place ideas or designs that I wasn’t sure about using in the MVP. This purgatory allowed me to move forward with new ideas unencumbered because I knew I always had a purgatory with my old ideas or designs I could draw from if things went wrong with my current direction. I was able to put my best foot forward, rarely needing to look back.
