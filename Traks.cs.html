            <h1>Traks</h1>
            <h2>2016 - UX/UI Designer</h2>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "Introduction column full">
        <h3> The Introduction </h3>
        <p> Traks is all about stories, so it seems best to tell you the story of how we, my wife and I, created it. We were living in Colorado, visiting everywhere from Denver to Grand Junction. One day we were reminiscing about our adventures when the same conclusion came up again and again- “I don’t remember.” It was the death sentence of an experience and that’s what we set out to solve -the resurrection and preservation of a travel experience.
        </p>
    </div>
      <div class = " column full">
        <h4 class = "Black"> The Task </h4>
        <p> We were tasked with designing a web application to aid people with organizing their travel experiences -past, present, and future, allowing them to capture all their experiences and accessing them from anywhere. This project was important to us because of our passion for traveling and our frustrations with displaying our travel portfolio in a beautiful and approachable way.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class = "column full">
        <h4 class="Black"> The Problem </h4>
        <p>  There is no digital space to hold an entire travel experience -such as, personal ratings, media, maps, and journal entries. Moreover, no way existed to share an entire experience or invite others to collaborate on a new one. This leaves people full of memories and plans but no network to express and share them.
        </p>
      </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h4 class = "Black"> The Solution </h4>
        <p>  Traks allows people to trace their travels. In one digital space, users can upload media, record their thoughts, rate their individual experiences, visualize their tracks, and share with friends and family. A user can also look forward by planning a journey by allowing them to define destinations, transportation, companions, and travel dates. Or, if the user isn’t quite ready to plan out a journey, they can create a wishlist, which is also visualized on their map. And finally, once a user wants to publish their travels in a physical book, they can publish it through a site like Blurb.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h3> The Survey </h3>
        <p>  To gain insights from our users and protect against biases, we sent out a survey to discover what was meaningful to potential users. This step was crucial because it helped to keep our ideas grounded in reality and the project oriented toward users.
        </p>
        <h4 class ="Black"> Survey Intentions</h4>
        <p> With our survey we wanted to understand:</p>
        <p>
          1. The value of visual representation through a map.<br><br>
              2. The value of a rating system connected to individual experiences of a location.<br><br>
              3. What factors determined a location worthy of travel.<br><br>
              4. What aspects of a travel are important to record.<br><br>
              5. The value of publishing travel experiences through a site like Blurb.
        </p>
        <h4 class ="Black">Survey Results</h4>
        <p>1. 70% of people found a map valuable. <br><br>
            2. 70% of people found ratings to be valuable.<br><br>
            3. 88% of people said cost was important, 55% distance, 55% physical environment, 55% past experiences. <br><br>
            4. 100% of people found photos to be valuable for storing, 60% videos, 40% journal
          entries, 40% ratings.<br><br>
            5. 20% of people found the Blurb feature valuable.
        </p>
        <h4 class = "Black">Survey Inferences</h4>
        <p><b>Affirmed-</b> The survey informed us that a map, ratings, and media were worthwhile to the MVP.<br><br>
        <b>Denied-</b> We decided to drop the Blurb idea due to a lack of interest. Also, we had the idea to include voice recordings as a media option, but there was a lack of interest in this feature as well, so it too was dropped from the MVP.<br><br>
        <b>Insights-</b> From the survey, we realized that we needed to include a cost rating in conjunction to experience ratings.

        <h3> The Competition </h3>
        <p> Traks has two main components: sociability and archive navigability. Furthermore, our website had no direct competition, but its main components did. With these concepts being the goal we primarily looked at three sites: Facebook, Roadtrippers, and Nomad List.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Facebook, while the industry standard of social media, does little over a lot, giving many social options, but lacking depth in individual experience. For Traks, we wanted everything oriented around the user’s travel experiences. <br><br>
              2. Roadtrippers does a great job allowing the user to plan their trip and their map feature is great for viewing a potential route. However, it is one-dementional, allowing users to only plan a trip without carrying forward that information as some sort of travel log once the trip is executed.<br><br>
              3. Nomad List provides an intuitive way to filter choices and rank locations based on what the user chooses, yet it doesn’t allow a way to connect with friends, see their ratings, and collaborate.

        <h3> The Brand Identity </h3>
        <p> Traks was intended from the outset to be a personal, yet social platform for one’s travel experiences. Originally, we thought the name of the site would be “Travel Bug,” due to the explorative nature of the site’s users. However, bugs annoy people, and it doesn’t capture the personal and social spirit of the site. Thus, we landed on “Traks,” because it reminded us of a personal imprint left behind by a traveler, something similar to a fingerprint. Naturally, this led to a footprint as the focal point of the logo. As for the social nature of the site, we went with a stamp border, which also tied in nicely with our digital postcard idea (a special feature of the site).

      <p>For fonts, we wanted the titles to look strong and permanent, so we chose Bitter due to its strong, angular design. As for the rest of the , we wanted an easy-to-read font that was as non-distracting as possible. Thus, Poppins was our choice, especially since it was crafted with a digital screen display in mind.
      </p>
      <p>The color palette needed to be comprised of colors that were active yet calming -active, because of the explorative spirit of our intended users, and calming because we knew that our users would be inputing a lot of information -and traveling can easily lead to stress. We concluded that oranges and blues would dominate the palette.

        <h3> The Mockups </h3>
        <p>With research and brand identity under our belts, we began conceptualizing where on our pages the information would live. This part of the project consumed most of our time, as we first developed low fidelity mockups and then moved onto high fidelity. We regularly sent our designs to users and peers for feedback. Consequently, our mockups went through quite the evolution before reaching Traks Erectus.<br><br>This evolution of our content layout can be readily seen in the difference between our low fidelity mockups and our high Fidelity ones linked up with InVision:<br><br><a href="https://invis.io/Y99FJXP7Z#/206353700_RU_Traks_Journeys" target="_blank">Low Fidelity Returning User Home Page</a> , <a href="https://invis.io/FS9K9RYUW#/209226103_RU_Landing_Page" target="_blank">High Fidelity Returning User Home Page</a><br><br><a href="https://invis.io/Y99FJXP7Z#/206354193_Browse_Blank" target="_blank">Low Fidelity Browse Flow</a> , <a href="https://invis.io/FS9K9RYUW#/209377010_Browse_Blank" target="_blank">High Fidelity Browse Flow</a><br><br><a href="https://invis.io/Y99FJXP7Z#/206359836_Trak_A_Journey_Route_Details" target="_blank">Low Fidelity Trak a Journey Flow</a> , <a href="https://invis.io/FS9K9RYUW#/210034054_Blank_Slate_Route_Details_Small" target="_blank">High Fidelity Trak a Journey Flow</a> <br><br> We learned several lessons by pouring weeks into our mockups. Cheif among these lessons was scalability. While working in Sketch, we did not give enough consideration to the size of our elements as displayed through a browser. When we began prototyping with InVision, we realized that the elements on mockups were ENORMOUS! We had to rescale over two hundred mockups -an action which solidified a lesson we won't soon forget.

        <p>Expert advice through our process informed us that our work was too bulky and boxy. It was a common mistake for newer designers to place everything within a explicitly defined space. This way of thinking can create a very closed design, so our goal now became opening it up more. It was a breath of fresh air removing the boxes throughout the site. It did make a cleaner, freer design and has since contributed to our more minimalist design direction.

       <h3> Reflections</h3>
        <p>This project helped us to begin practicing designing in the wholistic con of a project. We learned to work together as two very different designers to created a website that looked whole. We also learned more about how all the different steps to designing actually fit together to create the “big picture.”
        </p>
        <p>Something useful we started doing in the project was the creatation of a “purgatory” to place ideas or designs we weren’t sure about using in our MVP. This purgatory allowed us to move forward with new ideas unencumbered because we knew we always had a purgatory with our old ideas or designs we could draw from if things went wrong with our current direction. We were able to put our best foot forward, rarely needing to look back.
