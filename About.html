            <h3>My Archimedean Point</h3>
            <p>My career in UX design stems from my relentless will to answer the question, what is the good life? This question has led me to thumb through the minds of philosophers, uproot myself from my home state, and walk up to strangers at gas stations, asking have seen the promotion today? 
            The accumulation of my pursuit has led me to UX design, because <b>chipping away at the answer of what is the good life is the essence of good UX design.</b> The good life is a story, so is good UX. The good life is social, so is good UX. The good life takes place in an established environment, so does good UX.<br><br>My passion to understand the good life informs and reinforces how I design. It is me putting to practicing what I’ve learned along my journey. I hear Nietzsche ranting about the will to power when I gamifying simple tasks. I keep Dante’s idea of slothfulness in mind when I wireframe. I listen to Occam sharpen his razor when I think about the scope of project features. All these things and more contribute to my process when I design because if users can’t add a little good to their lives when they use my design, then they won’t use it.</p>

            <h3>Lessons Along the Way</h3>
            <p>Yet, head knowledge can’t substitute experience. So where reading ends, my very different jobs begin. Despite their variety, however, these jobs too have contributed to laying the foundation of my career as a UX designer by teaching me invaluable lessons.</p>

            <h4>UX Lessons in Unlikely Places</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Waiting Tables:</b> I learned quickly that if you can give someone what they want before they know they want it, you’ll be greatly rewarded. I had to be quick on my feet. I only had about a minute to build rapport and know who I was serving. And when this situation was multiplied and time was short, I learned which parts of my role were crucial and which were malleable -the 80/20 rule. I learned about empathy and prioritization with this job.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sales Lead:</b> Approach 100 people a day. Make a sale 10% of the time. Up sell every chance you get. Go! I hustled car wax at a gas station, approaching people and showing off the wax on their car. I had only seconds to make a good impression and build enough trust for people to not call the cops. I learned quickly that people eat with their eyes, so never say what you can show. Also, I don’t know how I took feedback before this job, but after, I thirsted for it. When you work straight commission and don’t have a dollar to show for the four hours you’ve worked, you don’t have enough pride not to ask, what can I do better?</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Retirement Specialist:</b> I took inbound calls and handled accounts for a financial institution. Strict metrics were enforced, so I learned the art of asking questions. To understand what people want, you must file down an answer through questions that vary in scope -moving from global questions to clarifying questions. Most people know what they want, but communicating that desire requires more group than individual effort. Also, I learned there is such a thing as info dumping and that it is an easy pitfall.</li>

            <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
            <p>Although these experiences have produced flashes of the good life for me, they have taught me a bigger lesson: my life was only good when I have improved the lives of others. Moreover, I didn't achieve the good life by grabbing it for myself but by giving it to others. And isn’t that the core of good UX design? Don’t let your prejudices get in the way, conduct user research. Don’t let your narrative get in the way, build user stories. Don’t let your pride plug your ears, send out user testing.<br><br> The world is always changing and technology along with it, but people will always need someone to listen and provide thoughtful solutions. <b>Providing those solutions, for me, is living the good life.</b></p>
