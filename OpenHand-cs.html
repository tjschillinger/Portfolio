        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> Open Hand was an opportunity for my design team and I to explore branding and developing a crowdfunding website. We worked around the central idea of how comfortable a user feels giving through a site. 
        </p>
  </div>
  <div class = "column full">
        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p> The problem isn’t giving. The problem is how to give. Most people have the desire to help others but they are held back by their experiences with sites that do not appear trustworthy and are difficult to navigate. We set out to create a crowdfunding site that users could trust and use with ease. 
        </p>
  </div>   
    <div class = "column full">
        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p> Our solution was that we needed a website that elderly people with means could trust. Through user surveys we were able to discover that the elderly seemed to be the most eligible to give but the biggest hindrance to their generosity was a lack of trust for the website. On the other side of the spectrum we had younger people who couldn’t give large sums of money but wanted a solution where they could give small amounts of money on a regular basis. So our website needed to be agile enough to accommodate  the younger and older generations.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h4> The Process </h4>
        <p> We were less interested in promoting consumerism and more interested in connecting people. We know many elderly people who are very generous but limited in their options because of their fear of the internet. Being Junior UX/UI Designers, we set out to see if we could solve this issue. <br><br> The first thing we did was create surveys to identify areas we can improve to build trust. We discovered that it’s valuable to have detailed profile pages that include photos, bios, and donations from others. It’s also important to have reviews, endorsements, and financial records readily available.<br> <br>From there we completed a SWOT analyses of our competitors to help determine the direction of our design and how our competitors approached these problems. GoFundMe, our main competitor, used a simple interface with a profile section to build trust so we knew we needed something similar. <br><br>We went through many iterations with our pages, using expert feedback and our competitors, to design a practical, easy layout that would be credible. 
        </p>

        <h3> Brand Identity </h3>
        <p> We originally wanted to apply happy, bright colors to the website to provide a more jubilant tone. Our user feedback, however, quickly nixed our first choices and led to a more conservative selection. With the site’s logo, we wanted something that would easily convey a sense of giving. Naturally, we chose a hand to be the centerpiece.

        <h3> The Mockups </h3>
        <p> Originally, we had multiple icons representing the various categories that we could browse on the home page. These icons were bulky and distracting though. Per expert feedback we removed them and just simplified by listing the category names. The result was much more visually coherent.

        <p> The initial profile page lacked any ability to monitor comments which we realized quickly would be very important if we wanted to be a credible site. We gave users the ability to report inappropriate comments and the page owner has the ability to delete comments.

        <p>We were also worried about our charts being confusing with our colors and layouts and we decided to simplify the design to make it easier for the user to process.

        <h3> Final Thoughts </h3>
        <p><b>What worked? </b> We created a website that had the all necessary information in order to donate and even donate on a recurring basis. Our profile page provided a friendly environment to become acquainted with someone in need. Also our browsing navigation was intuitive.
        </p>
        <p><b>What didn't work?</b> Branding wasn’t too strong because more people ended up associating our hand logo with a signal to stop. Also the scroll-down, form like donation page was offsetting to some, coming across as too laborious to finish. 
        </p>
        <p><b>What were the doubts going into the project?</b> We weren’t sure how to balance a platform that would appeal to both the young and elderly in our target audience.
        </p>
        <p><b>Any surprises?</b> We were most surprised when looking back on the project to see how much time we could have saved if we had committed more time to research in the initial stages. The most streamlined part of our project came when we opened our blinders and looked to what users were saying and how other sites solved similar issues, which can be most readily seen in our profile page and browse page.
        </p>
        <p><b>What would you have done differently if given more time?</b> We would have definitely conducted more research not only through user surveys but also through analyzing our competition. We spent altogether too much time working in isolation and should have embraced the flux user opinion and tried methods. We also would have kept more project artifacts to document the project’s evolution -too many artifacts were saved over.  
        </p>
        <p><b>Learning Lessons:</b> Since this project required more information to be displayed at once, we refined our understanding of information hierarchy, which began to show itself most acutely in the last two flows we developed, our browse flow and profile page. Learning how to guide a user’s attention through areas and subareas that held components of components was a welcome challenge.
