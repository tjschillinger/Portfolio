                    There are 2 ways to redeem the points you earn: <br><br> 1. If you are visiting the vendor in person, confirm the reward you want via our app’s store. After confirmation, you’ll be presented with a grey and white box in the middle of your screen. This is your QR code. Go to the vendor’s checkout and have someone scan your QR code. This will complete the transaction. <br><br>2. If you are ordering your reward online, confirm the reward you want via our app’s store. After confirmation, you’ll be presented with a grey and white box in the middle of your screen. Below that you’ll see a button that says, “Redeem Online.” Select that button, and you’ll go to the vendor’s website for their online checkout. A series of letters and numbers will populate the “Promo Code” field. DO NOT ALTER THIS CODE. Proceed through the vendor’s checkout  process. This will complete the transaction.

                    As long as you have not already redeemed the reward with the vendor, then you may convert your chosen reward back into points. However, if you have already gone to the vendor and received your reward from them, then there is no way to return the reward and receive your point back.

                    We are currently working on a kid's version of the Human Kind. This version will have challenges specifically tailored to children, such as completing chores and helping their parents. Moreover, the child version will have vendors more specific to providing child products. But, that's not to say Human Kind in its current version is not kid friendly. Children may freely use Human Kind with parental consent.

                    There are many marketing advantages in becoming a vendor for Human Kind. Getting the word out about you business is an oppertunity no business can afford to forfeit. Plus, Human Kind allows that word to spread through acts of kindness, which is a very positive medium to pass through.

                    Human Kind cannot guarantee any moral outcome it may have on its users. We do, however, believe that behaviors can affect the inner life of a person, but those effects are to subjective to guarantee.
