                    There are 2 ways to redeem the points you earn: <br><br> 1. If you are visiting the vendor in person, confirm the reward you want via our app’s store. After confirmation, you’ll be presented with a grey and white box in the middle of your screen. This is your QR code. Go to the vendor’s checkout and have someone scan your QR code. This will complete the transaction. <br><br>2. If you are ordering your reward online, confirm the reward you want via our app’s store. After confirmation, you’ll be presented with a grey and white box in the middle of your screen. Below that you’ll see a button that says, “Redeem Online.” Select that button, and you’ll go to the vendor’s website for their online checkout. A series of letters and numbers will populate the “Promo Code” field. DO NOT ALTER THIS CODE. Proceed through the vendor’s checkout  process. This will complete the transaction.
